## How to add a data source

### Option 1: Edit the CSV file

Our data sources are stored in a CSV file on [our Github repository](https://github.com/cybergreen-net/inventory.cybergreen.net) under `_data/sources.csv`.

If you would like to add a source, best practice is to fork and clone the repository, edit the CSV file and submit a pull request.

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally. Instructions on how to fork a repository and submit pull requests are available [on Github's website](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Create a new row in the `_data/sources.csv` file, below the header line. Edit the row to match the headings, including at least: the title, owner and homepage of the source.

3. Save your changes, commit and push to your fork.

4. Submit a pull request.

### Option 2: Create an issue in the issue tracker

Alternatively, you can submit details of the source to us by creating an issue in [our repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/cybergreen-net/inventory.cybergreen.net/issues). When creating the issue, take care to include all pertinent details about the source, including its title, owner and the homepage of the source.
