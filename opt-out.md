The Cyber Green Institute helps policy makers and CSIRTs focus their remediation efforts on key systemic risks; to help understand where improvements can be made and how, together, we can achieve a more sustainable, secure, and resilient cyber ecosystem. The Cyber Green Institute achieves this by Cyber Health Measurement, Sourcing Data, Providing a Clearing House for Mitigation, Capacity Building and Advocacy. With the help of organizations such as yours, along with our partners, we have initiated a public awareness campaign to ensure that governments, businesses, the media, and individuals recognize the value of a healthy cyber ecosystem.
