<p>I had the great pleasure of joining the cerebration of CGI.Br's 20th Anniversary and I was lucky enough to have an opportunity to promote the CyberGreen initiative to the Brazilian CERT community.&nbsp;</p><p>The room was filled with positive energy from the Brazilian CERT community, where discussions and questions were based on their actual experiences faced.</p><p>And of course, the discussions with Cristine and Klaus from CERT.Br were extremely inspiring for CyberGreen. Their input was based on their invaluable experience stemming from their long time focused efforts aimed at the improvement of ecosystem health. I am very excited that we could create a good collaboration plan, in particular around cataloging the mitigation best practices with them!</p><p>Author:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yurie Ito<br />Contact: &nbsp;yito@cybergreen.net</p>
