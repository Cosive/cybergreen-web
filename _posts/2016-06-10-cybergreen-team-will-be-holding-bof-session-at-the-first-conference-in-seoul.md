Barry Greene, Paul Vixie, Aaron Kaplan, and Yurie Ito will present the CyberGreen v.2 plan and review BCPs at the FIRST conference in Seoul, South Korea on June 16, 2016. The team will gather input from the available data to measure the impact/efficiency of BCPs over risk conditions (infection/vulnerabilities/misconfigurations). CyberGreen is a global community initiative to measure and improve cyber ecosystem health. We'd like to invite you to participate and welcome your feedback. Looking forward to seeing you all!
