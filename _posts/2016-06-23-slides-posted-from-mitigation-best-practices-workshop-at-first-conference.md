On June 15, 2016, CyberGreen ran a workshop with our BCP experts Paul Vixie and Barry Greene on Mitigation Best Practices at the FIRST Conference in Seoul, South Korea. At that workshop, historical practices were reviewed and CyberGreen’s methodology was discussed. The vision and process of CyberGreen’s work over the coming months in producing mitigation BCP capacity building material, and developing metrics and data to evaluate/demonstrate the impact and efficiency of efforts were also outlined.
