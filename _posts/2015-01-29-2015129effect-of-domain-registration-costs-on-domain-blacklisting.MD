title: Effect of Domain Registration Costs on Domain Blacklisting

One of the key questions in addressing cybercrime is how to apply economics to the problem. Specifically, how can we raise the costs for attackers above the returns they may enjoy, to make cybercrime less attractive to them. Domain name registration costs present one possible avenue for these costs.

To study the possible return on this approach, we analyzed Cyber Green data to look for a correlation between the cost to register a domain name and occurrence of blacklisting for a domain name with that TLD. Grouping the unique domain names together by TLD, we can begin to assess the likely outcome of this approach. Starting with the hypothesis that there will be a negative correlation between the two, data about blacklisted domains for several days was aggregated. These URLs and domain names represent malware and phishing, common avenues for cybercrime.

What we found, shown in the figure below, while there exists a negative correlation, it is not as absolute as we would want to justify raising domain name registration prices in an effort to combat cybercrime. The figure shows the count of unique domain names, grouped by TLD, on the x-axis and the cost to register a domain name on the y-axis. The movement of the data down and to the right across this plot (note that the number of unique domains for any TLD is on a *log base 10* scale) is consistent with the hypothesis, but the crowding in the lower *left* corner suggests that this relationship is not absolute. An outlier, .tt, presents an interesting case.

Given this result, raising prices to combat cybercrime would have too great a risk on legitimate domain name registration and the resulting net-positive contributions to the economy and too little effect on cyber crime. But this simple example illustrates the power of analysis and correlation in hypothesis testing to combat cybercrime.
