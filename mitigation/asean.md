## Welcome to the CyberGreen-ASEAN Mitigation Resource Portal

CyberGreen measures the presence of risk conditions to the Internet, and generates a Cyber Ecosystem health state index by country and AS (Anonymous System).

This Cyber Mitigation Resource Portal is co-developed by CyberGreen and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) of Singapore. It aims to provide ASEAN Member States with a regional view on the cyber health state and the necessary resources needed to enhance our remediation efforts collectively. In light of its commitment to a healthier Cyber Ecosystem, CyberGreen will collaborate with Singapore as its focal point for the ASEAN region.

## What is CyberGren?

CyberGreen is a global non-profit and collaborative organization conducting activities focused on helping to improve the health of the global Cyber Ecosystem. CyberGreen will achieve this by providing reliable metrics, measurements, and mitigation best practices to Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), network operators, and policy makers.

Using its measurement of risk conditions posed to the global Internet, CyberGreen formulates an index that can be presented in three views: 

1. ASEAN Regional View
2. Country-Level View
3. Anonymous System (AS) View

## ASEAN Regional View

The ASEAN regional view provides a snapshot of remediation achievements and progress collectively.

## Country-Level View

The country-level view provides the count of vulnerable devices for the four risk indicators within each country.

## CyberGreen Metrics (Mitigation Campaign)

CyberGreen develops and applies statistical methods to data, allowing for measurement of key indicators of malicious activity and risk conditions. These methods provide analytical insight about patterns, priorities, and trends for action by the CERT/CSIRT community and others. Using state-of-the-art metrics-based measurement and visualization, CyberGreen produces an Index score for four risk indicators using 1 TB of validated data collected from multiple sources. The four risk indicators are Open DNS, Open NTP, Open SSDP, and Spam.

### Risks

+ <b>Open DNS</b>: The Domain Name System (DNS) is pervasive. Collectively, we use it billions of times a day, often without even knowing that it exists. For enterprises, it's their digital identity as well as a critical component of their security architecture. In short: DNS is pervasive and there are many DNS servers on the Internet. Since DNS runs on the UDP protocol, it can be used for amplification attacks. <a href="http://stats.cybergreen.net/risk/opendns/">Read more &raquo;</a>

+ <b>Open NTP</b>: Computers and network devices have a perversely strong need to have good agreement about what constitutes the current time (accurate precision time is critical for authentication related purposes, accurate event logging, and a host of other things). Most computers stay synchronized using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Oversimplifying greatly, NTP sets the local time by checking the time as reported by multiple trusted high-precision network-accessible clocks. Just like DNS, NTP is a UDP-based service, and shares the same weaknesses that DNS does (particularly problems with spoofed traffic, traffic amplification, and unnecessarily promiscuous access to servers). <a href="http://stats.cybergreen.net/risk/openntp/">Read more &raquo;</a>

+ <b>Open SSDP</b>: the Simple Service Discovery Protocol is used for advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information. It is often enabled in customer end devices (CPEs) such as modems, WLAN modems. Since SSDP runs over UDP, again, it can be used for UDP reflection attacks. <a href="http://stats.cybergreen.net/risk/openssdp/">Read more &raquo;</a>

+ <b>Spam</b>: Spam is roughly equivalent to unsolicited telephone marketing calls, except that the user pays for part of the message since everyone shares the cost of maintaining the Internet. Spammers typically send a piece of e-mail to a distribution list in the millions, expecting that only a tiny number of readers will respond to their offer. It has become a major problem for all Internet users. <a href="http://stats.cybergreen.net/risk/spam/">Read more &raquo;</a>
